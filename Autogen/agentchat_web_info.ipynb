            "\n",
            "2. **Incorrect Table Names**: This error occurs when the table name specified in the SQL query does not exist in the database.\n",

            "3. **Incorrect Column Names**: Similar to incorrect table names, this error occurs when the column name specified in the SQL query does not exist in the table.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Data Type Mismatch**: This error occurs when you try to insert or update data in a column with a data type that does not match the data type of the column.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Violation of Unique Constraints**: This error occurs when you try to insert a duplicate value in a column with a unique constraint.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Violation of Foreign Key Constraints**: This error occurs when you try to insert a value in a foreign key column that does not exist in the referenced primary key column.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Incorrect Use of NULL**: This error occurs when you try to insert a NULL value in a column that does not allow NULL values.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Incorrect Use of Aggregate Functions**: This error occurs when you use aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN incorrectly.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. **Incorrect Use of Subqueries**: This error occurs when subqueries are not used correctly, such as returning more than one value when only one is expected.\n",
            "\n",
            "10. **Incorrect Use of Joins**: This error occurs when joins are not used correctly, such as trying to join tables on columns that do not have matching data.\n",
            "\n",
            "These are general errors and the exact error message may vary depending on the SQL database management system being used. It's always a good practice to carefully read the error message as it usually contains information about what went wrong.\n",
