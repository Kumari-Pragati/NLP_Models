        "# When the temperature is 0, the model will always choose the term that has the highest probability. Because the model can choose a term with a slightly lower probability when the temperature is higher, there is more variance, unpredictability, and originality. Depending on the task for which you are providing the GPT, you can adjust the temperature. For transformational tasks like extraction, the ideal temperature range is between 0 and 0.3 degrees Celsius. We should use a higher temperature, closer to 0.5, to write jobs. Use values between 0.7 and 1 if GPT's creativity is required to be very strong.\n"
